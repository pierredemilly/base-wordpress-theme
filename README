Basic Wordpress Theme
=====================

My basic Wordpress theme I use for most projects these days.
Feel free to use it if you have the same workflow!

Wordpress
---------
Basic Wordpress theme requirements are included:
  * a screenshot file
  * theme details in the stylesheet
  * header/index/footer templates with required Wordpress functions
  * a functions file
  * favicon and Apple touch icon

Sass
----
This theme uses Sass and compiles everything into a style.css.

Sass imports include:
  * normalize.css
  * useful mixins from Compass
  * color and font variables files
  * a 960px 12cols grid system

Javascript &amp; Coffeescript
-----------------------------
This theme uses Coffeescript for the script file, compiled into a script.js file.

jQuery is imported from the Google CDN.

Mondernizr v2.5.3 and Respond.js v1.1.0 are included as javascript files.

Every script is imported through Wordpress in the functions template file.
